[Apify](https://apify.com/) is the place to find, develop, buy and run cloud programs called actors. These actors allow you to perform web scraping, data extraction or automation tasks on any website, regardless whether it has an API or not. Their actors, tasks, and datasets allow you and your team to have the data of the web at your fingertips.

The best Apify solutions are ones that are able to relay their information with as little manual input as possible. If the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) does not have the solution that works for you, Transposit provides the perfect platform for you to begin developing your own app with any Apify actor you like. Transposit handles the overhead so you get to focus on the fun. Imagine connecting Apify to Slack, Google Sheets, or Twilio without worrying about auth!

## Key Features

<div class="landing-title">Managed authentication üîê</div>
<div class="landing-copy">Your Apify integrations need to work with cloud services on behalf of your users. Transposit manages users, their credentials, refreshing tokens, and storing them securely.</div>

<div class="landing-title">User customization üé®</div>
<div class="landing-copy">When you‚Äôre building a custom Apify integration you want it to be, well, custom! Transposit gives a simple mechanism to let users customize: specify a custom start URL, sync run information to Slack, query your datasets as if they were in SQL</div>

<div class="landing-title">Broad API support üì±</div>
<div class="landing-copy">Connect and authenticate in seconds to the services you use. Experiment interactively rather than scouring documentation. Check out the growing list of connectors <a href="/docs/references/data-connectors/">here</a></div>

<div class="landing-title">Up-level your work ü§î</div>
<div class="landing-copy">Transposit‚Äôs relational engine puts SQL in front of any API. And lets you mix in JavaScript when you need. Write less code in a language designed to manipulate, transform, and compose data.</div>

<div class="landing-title">Severless üöÄ</div>
<div class="landing-copy">Build your logic and let Transposit host it for you. Build and deploy an app for your entire team in minutes. Really.</div>

<div class="landing-title">Fork and customize examples üå≥</div>
<div class="landing-copy">Try some of our sample apps or some apps built by other developers. Close but not what you need? Fork it, and customize it. You don‚Äôt need to start from scratch.</div>
