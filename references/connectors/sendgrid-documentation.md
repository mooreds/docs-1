## add_authenticated_domain_to_subuser

**This endpoint allows you to associate a specific domain whitelabel with a subuser.**

A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

Domain whitelabels can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's whitelabels. To associate a whitelabel with a subuser, the parent account must first create the whitelabel and validate it. The the parent may then associate the whitelabel via the subuser management tools.

For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)

## URI Parameters

must first create a whitelabel and validate it. The parent may then associate that whitelabel with a subuser via the API or the Subuser Management page in the user interface.

Email link whitelabels allow all of the click-tracked links you send in your emails to include the URL of your domain instead of sendgrid.net.

For more information, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Whitelabel/links.html).

## authenticate_domain

**This endpoint allows you to create a whitelabel for one of your domains.**

If you are creating a domain whitelabel that you would like a subuser to use, you have two options:
1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel.
2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel.

A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider.

Suppression groups, or [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html), allow you to label a category of content that you regularly send. This gives your recipients the ability to opt out of a specific set of your email. For example, you might define a group for your transactional email, and one for your marketing email so that your users can continue recieving your transactional email witout having to receive your marketing content.

You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.
