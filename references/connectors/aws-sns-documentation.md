## publish

Sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic or sends a text message (SMS message) directly to a phone number.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html

<details><summary>Parameters</summary>

#### Message (required)

The message you want to send. Important The Message parameter is always a string. If you set MessageStructure to json, you must string-encode the Message parameter. If you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a String value. If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the MessageStructure parameter to json and use a JSON object for the Message parameter. See the Examples section for the format of the JSON object. Constraints: With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144 characters). For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters, or 70 UCS-2 characters. If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS sends the  message as multiple messages, each fitting within the size limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at whole-word boundaries. The total size limit for a single SMS Publish action is 1,600 characters. JSON-specific constraints: Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values. The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages. Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending). Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is allowed). Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes). Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored. Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored. Duplicate keys are not allowed. Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the Publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).

**Type:** STRING

#### MessageAttributes.entry.N

Array of names of message attributes for Publish action. String to MessageAttributeValue object map. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_MessageAttributeValue.html.

**Type:** ARRAY

#### MessageStructure

Set MessageStructure to json if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set MessageStructure to json, the value of the Message parameter must:  be a syntactically valid JSON object; and contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value that is a string. You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http"). For information about sending different messages for each protocol using the AWS Management Console, go to Create Different Messages for Each Protocol in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Getting Started Guide.  Valid value: json

**Type:** STRING

#### PhoneNumber

The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use E.164 format. If you don't specify a value for the PhoneNumber parameter, you must specify a value for the TargetArn or TopicArn parameters.

#### Subject

Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the message is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to other endpoints. Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter, number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.

**Type:** STRING

#### TargetArn

Either TopicArn or EndpointArn, but not both. If you don't specify a value for the TargetArn parameter, you must specify a value for the PhoneNumber or TopicArn parameters.

For the lambda protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an AWS Lambda function.

**Type:** STRING

#### Protocol (required)

The protocol you want to use. Supported protocols include: http – delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTP POST https – delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTPS POST email – delivery of message via SMTP email-json – delivery of JSON-encoded message via SMTP sms – delivery of message via SMS sqs – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon SQS queue application – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an EndpointArn for a mobile app and device. lambda – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an AWS Lambda function.

**Type:** STRING

#### TopicArn (required)

The ARN of the topic you want to subscribe to.

**Type:** STRING

#### Attributes.entry.N.key

Array of names of attributes. The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the SetTopicAttributes action uses: DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries  to HTTP/S endpoints. FilterPolicy – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber receive only  a subset of messages, rather than receiving every message published to the topic. RawMessageDelivery – When set to true, enables raw message delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.

**Type:** ARRAY

#### Attributes.entry.N.value

Array of values of corresponding attributes. The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the SetTopicAttributes action uses: DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries  to HTTP/S endpoints. FilterPolicy – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber receive only  a subset of messages, rather than receiving every message published to the topic. RawMessageDelivery – When set to true, enables raw message delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints.

**Type:** ARRAY

#### ReturnSubscriptionArn

Sets whether the response from the Subscribe request includes the subscription ARN, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed. If you set this parameter to false, the response includes the ARN for confirmed subscriptions, but it includes an ARN value of "pending subscription" for subscriptions that are not yet confirmed. A subscription becomes confirmed when the subscriber calls the ConfirmSubscription action with a confirmation token. If you set this parameter to true, the response includes the ARN in all cases, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed. The default value is false.

**Type:** BOOLEAN

## unsubscribe

Deletes a subscription. If the subscription requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an AWS signature is required. If the Unsubscribe call does not require authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the Unsubscribe request was unintended.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Unsubscribe.html
