## put_record

Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call PutRecord to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html

<details><summary>Parameters</summary>

#### Data (required)

The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded when the blob is serialized. When the data blob (the payload before base64-encoding) is added to the partition key size, the total size must not exceed the maximum record size (1 MiB).

**Type:** STRING

#### PartitionKey (required)

Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream.

**Type:** STRING

#### StreamName (required)

The name of the stream to put the data record into.

**Type:** STRING

#### ExplicitHashKey

The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is assigned to by overriding the partition key hash.

Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts from the same client and to the same partition key. Usage: set the SequenceNumberForOrdering of record n to the sequence number of record n-1 (as returned in the result when putting record n-1). If this parameter is not set, records are coarsely ordered based on arrival time.

**Type:** STRING

</details>

## put_records

## register_stream_consumer

Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this operation, the consumer you register can then call SubscribeToShard to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterStreamConsumer.html

<details><summary>Parameters</summary>

#### ConsumerName (required)

For a given Kinesis data stream, each consumer must have a unique name. However, consumer names don't have to be unique across data streams.

<details><summary>Parameters</summary>

#### NewStartingHashKey (required)

A hash key value for the starting hash key of one of the child shards created by the split. The hash key range for a given shard constitutes a set of ordered contiguous positive integers. The value for NewStartingHashKey must be in the range of hash keys being mapped into the shard. The NewStartingHashKey hash key value and all higher hash key values in hash key range are distributed to one of the child shards. All the lower hash key values in the range are distributed to the other child shard.
