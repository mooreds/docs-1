## create_cluster

Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a default cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the CreateCluster action.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCluster.html

<details><summary>Parameters</summary>

#### clusterName

The name of your cluster. If you do not specify a name for your cluster, you create a cluster named default. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. 

**Type:** STRING

#### tags

The metadata that you apply to the cluster to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters. 

**Type:** ARRAY

</details>

## create_service

Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below desiredCount, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see UpdateService.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html

<details><summary>Parameters</summary>

#### serviceName (required)

The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions. 

**Type:** STRING

#### taskDefinition (required)

The family and revision (family:revision) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a revision is not specified, the latest ACTIVE revision is used. 

**Type:** STRING

#### clientToken

Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Up to 32 ASCII characters are allowed. 

**Type:** STRING

#### cluster

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your service. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed. 

**Type:** STRING

#### deploymentConfiguration

Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks. 

**Type:** OBJECT

#### deploymentController

The deployment controller to use for the service. 

**Type:** OBJECT

#### desiredCount

The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep running on your cluster. 

**Type:** INTEGER

#### enableECSManagedTags

Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. 

**Type:** BOOLEAN

#### healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds

The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up. 

**Type:** INTEGER

#### launchType

The launch type on which to run your service. For more information, see Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. 

**Type:** STRING

#### loadBalancers

A load balancer object representing the load balancer to use with your service. If the service is using the ECS deployment controller, you are limited to one load balancer or target group. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it. After you create a service using the ECS deployment controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service. For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here. For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here. Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance. 

**Type:** ARRAY

#### networkConfiguration

The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. 

**Type:** OBJECT

#### placementConstraints

An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).  

**Type:** ARRAY

#### placementStrategy

The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per service. 

**Type:** ARRAY

#### platformVersion

The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one is not specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. 

**Type:** STRING

#### propagateTags

Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks in the service. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks within the service during service creation. To add tags to a task after service creation, use the TagResource API action. 

**Type:** STRING

#### role

The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition does not use the awsvpc network mode. If you specify the role parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the loadBalancers parameter. Important If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, in which case you should not specify a role here. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name bar has a path of /foo/ then you would specify /foo/bar as the role name. For more information, see Friendly Names and Paths in the IAM User Guide. 

**Type:** STRING

#### schedulingStrategy

The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see Services. There are two service scheduler strategies available: REPLICA-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller. DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. When you are using this strategy, there is no need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. Note Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the CODE_DEPLOY deploymenet controller do not support the DAEMON scheduling strategy. 

**Type:** STRING

#### serviceRegistries

The details of the service discovery registries to assign to this service. For more information, see Service Discovery. Note Service discovery is supported for Fargate tasks if you are using platform version v1.1.0 or later. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions. 

**Type:** ARRAY

#### tags

The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as well. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters. 

**Type:** ARRAY

</details>

## delete_account_setting

**Type:** STRING

#### principalArn

The ARN of the principal, which can be an IAM user, IAM role, or the root user. If you specify the root user, it modifies the ARN and resource ID format for all IAM users, IAM roles, and the root user of the account unless an IAM user or role explicitly overrides these settings for themselves. If this field is omitted, the setting are changed only for the authenticated user. 

**Type:** STRING

The task desired status with which to filter the ListTasks results. Specifying a desiredStatus of STOPPED limits the results to tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to STOPPED. This can be useful for debugging tasks that are not starting properly or have died or finished. The default status filter is RUNNING, which shows tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to RUNNING. Note Although you can filter results based on a desired status of PENDING, this does not return any results. Amazon ECS never sets the desired status of a task to that value (only a task's lastStatus may have a value of PENDING).

## register_task_definition

Registers a new task definition from the supplied family and containerDefinitions. Optionally, you can add data volumes to your containers with the volumes parameter. For more information about task definition parameters and defaults, see Amazon ECS Task Definitions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterTaskDefinition.html

<details><summary>Parameters</summary>

#### containerDefinitions (required)

A list of container definitions in JSON format that describe the different containers that make up your task. 

**Type:** ARRAY

#### family (required)

You must specify a family for a task definition, which allows you to track multiple versions of the same task definition. The family is used as a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. 

**Type:** STRING

#### cpu

The number of CPU units used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using CPU units, for example 1024, or as a string using vCPUs, for example 1 vCPU or 1 vcpu, in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the CPU units when the task definition is registered. Note Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers. If you are using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. Supported values are between 128 CPU units (0.125 vCPUs) and 10240 CPU units (10 vCPUs). If you are using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of supported values for the memory parameter: 256 (.25 vCPU) - Available memory values: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) 512 (.5 vCPU) - Available memory values: 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) 1024 (1 vCPU) - Available memory values: 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) 2048 (2 vCPU) - Available memory values: Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) 4096 (4 vCPU) - Available memory values: Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) 

**Type:** STRING

#### executionRoleArn

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that the Amazon ECS container agent and the Docker daemon can assume. 

**Type:** STRING

#### ipcMode

The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are host, task, or none. If host is specified, then all containers within the tasks that specified the host IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If task is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same IPC resources. If none is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more information, see IPC settings in the Docker run reference. If the host IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace expose. For more information, see Docker security. If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using systemControls for the containers in the task, the following will apply to your IPC resource namespace. For more information, see System Controls in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace related systemControls are not supported. For tasks that use the task IPC mode, IPC namespace related systemControls will apply to all containers within a task. Note This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type. 

**Type:** STRING

#### memory

The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using MiB, for example 1024, or as a string using GB, for example 1GB or 1 GB, in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the MiB when the task definition is registered. Note Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers. If using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. If using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of supported values for the cpu parameter: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) - Available cpu values: 256 (.25 vCPU) 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) - Available cpu values: 512 (.5 vCPU) 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) - Available cpu values: 1024 (1 vCPU) Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 2048 (2 vCPU) Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 4096 (4 vCPU) 

**Type:** STRING

#### networkMode

The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are none, bridge, awsvpc, and host. The default Docker network mode is bridge. If you are using the Fargate launch type, the awsvpc network mode is required. If you are using the EC2 launch type, any network mode can be used. If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.  If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Note Currently, only Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs, other Amazon Linux variants with the ecs-init package, or AWS Fargate infrastructure support the awsvpc network mode.  If the network mode is host, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used. Docker for Windows uses different network modes than Docker for Linux. When you register a task definition with Windows containers, you must not specify a network mode. If you use the console to register a task definition with Windows containers, you must choose the <default> network mode object.  For more information, see Network settings in the Docker run reference. 

**Type:** STRING

#### pidMode

The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are host or task. If host is specified, then all containers within the tasks that specified the host PID mode on the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If task is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same process namespace. If no value is specified, the default is a private namespace. For more information, see PID settings in the Docker run reference. If the host PID mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired process namespace expose. For more information, see Docker security. Note This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type. 

**Type:** STRING

This parameter is required for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Note Updating a service to add a subnet to a list of existing subnets does not trigger a service deployment. For example, if your network configuration change is to keep the existing subnets and simply add another subnet to the network configuration, this does not trigger a new service deployment. 

**Type:** OBJECT

#### platformVersion

The platform version on which your tasks in the service are running. A platform version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one is not specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. For more information, see AWS Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. 

**Type:** STRING
